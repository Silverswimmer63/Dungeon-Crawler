/*
Make a function called randomFoe();
for now, make this in javascript.js
It should do the following at first implementation -
1. Take the list of all the opponents.
2. Find out how long that list is.
3. Use that number and and randomness to get an index for that list.
4. Access (but do not remove) the object at that index to make a copy of that foe.
This means take the template, and use it to make a new monster of the correct class.
for example, if the class was Cowboy, it should make a new object of Class Cowboy.
5. Return that object.

You will know this works if the following happens in console when you try to run it:

var foo = randomFoe();
when you then type foo, you should have a random foe from the list you made.

/* 5 Update randomFoe() so that monsters with inventories have loot
A. use instanceof to see IF the said monster's class inherits the inventory class.
B. IF it does then once you have made the monster (but before you return it), use
randomItem() to make an item. Then use the correct method from class Inventory to
get that item for the inventory. */
